# Project Name
Symphony Pie is an audio visualizer built using Python. Itâ€™s a simple web app that takes input as a music (mp3) then outputs a video containing the music with really nice visualization. Users can create an account and save all their videos in a single dashboard. They can log in each time to get back to access their previous files. We also provide an option to download the video locally to the device. The app is built using the best technologies and the UI is designed aesthetically using the CSS Bulma framework. Even a user with no technical knowledge can easily use our app for this purpose.
